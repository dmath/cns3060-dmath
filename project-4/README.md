I enjoyed this project for once, I didn't have to use vim(much) or C, so it was quite easy.

The fcfs was very easy to implement.  For me the hardest was sstf, and elevator was inbetween the two.

Fcfs is easy in implementation, but very slow compared to other 2, it is, however, very fair, and dosen't result in starvation easily.

Sstf is almost always the fastest algorithm, however, it can lead to starvation if a process is far away in memory and shorter ones keep getting added.

Elevator is usually close in efficeny to sstf, while being slightly slower, but also more fair.
