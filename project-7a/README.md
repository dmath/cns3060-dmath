I really had a hard time with the project.  I felt you spent about 10 minutes in class talking about signals
and signal handling, and while I understand(somewhat) the basic concepts behind it, I still have a really hard time with
the syntax and some of the concepts.  I also felt that the way the book covered signals did not coincide with the way the project
used them.
