Project-7b

I felt that this project was harder than the first scheduling simulation.
I don't think that I really understand how round-robin works.  My algorithm
implements it accourding to how i thought it did, but it dosen't match the
given output.

The way I see it (using the sample data) you would do 4 seconds of process 1, then 2 of process 2, and then it would go to process 3, since it arrives at 
5 seconds and you've been going for 6 seconds now.

Anyways, I was very glad I could use c# and did not need to do this one in c.
